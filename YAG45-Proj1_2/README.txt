1. To run the lexical analyzer, you only need to use the command: ./main ****.mjava. 
For example, to test the analysing result of test.mjava, the command is ./main test.mjava. 
I have already put all the test files in this folder, but if you want to test other files, 
please use the correct path.
(I have tried the binary can sussessfully work on elements.cs.pitt.edu)

2. minijava.l is the the lexical analyzer written by me.

3. lex.yy.c is generated by minijava.l
